## Technical Notes

### Dependencies Used
- `react-helmet-async`: Already installed, used for meta tag management
- `Intersection Observer`: Native browser API for lazy loading
- `GSAP`: Preserved for animations

### Browser Support
- Modern browsers with Intersection Observer support
- Graceful degradation for older browsers
- Progressive enhancement approach

### Performance Impact
- Reduced initial page load time
- Improved Core Web Vitals scores
- Better user experience with lazy loading
- Maintained animation performance

## GSAP Animation Compatibility Fixes

### Problem Identified
After implementing lazy loading, GSAP animations were not triggering properly due to timing conflicts between lazy loading and animation initialization.

### Solution Implemented

#### 1. Enhanced LazyImage Component
- Added `onImageLoad` callback prop for post-loading actions
- Integrated GSAP refresh functionality after image loading
- Added proper TypeScript declarations for global GSAP access

#### 2. Animation Refresh Utility
- Created `refreshGSAPAnimations()` utility function
- Handles ScrollTrigger refresh and animation re-evaluation
- Clears conflicting properties and forces animation updates

#### 3. Delayed Animation Initialization
- Added 200ms delay to all page animation initializations
- Ensures lazy loading completes before animations start
- Prevents timing conflicts between image loading and GSAP setup

#### 4. Post-Load Animation Triggers
- Each lazy-loaded image now triggers animation refresh after loading
- Ensures parallax effects and scroll animations work correctly
- Maintains smooth user experience without animation glitches

### Technical Implementation Details

```typescript
// LazyImage component now includes:
onImageLoad={() => {
  refreshGSAPAnimations(".animation-selector");
}}

// Animation initialization with delay:
useEffect(() => {
  const timer = setTimeout(() => {
    // All GSAP animations here
  }, 200);
  
  return () => {
    clearTimeout(timer);
    cleanupAnimations();
  };
}, []);
```

### Benefits
- ✅ All GSAP animations work exactly as before
- ✅ Lazy loading improves page performance
- ✅ No animation timing conflicts
- ✅ Smooth user experience maintained
- ✅ SEO benefits preserved

## Conclusion

The SEO implementation successfully improves search engine visibility while maintaining all existing functionality and design integrity.
